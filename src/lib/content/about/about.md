# Welcome!

Hi! I'm Miquel (or Mike), a software engineer based in [Girona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girona).
I'm a software engineer who mainly works with frontend frameworks, mainly with
React and Svelte. I'm also really interested in working with other technologies
and I often take the opportunity to challenge myself with Rust (for the Advent
of Code, mainly!).

I'm always open for ideas, staying up to date with the technologies I use and also
learning and trying whatever I find interesting. While I have quite some projects
in my GitHub profile, most of them are simply a way for me to challenge myself and
try new things or approaches.
In a way, this portfolio is also a challenge/idea that came to my mind, most likely
while training on the bike.

When I'm not in my desktop, I'm most likely on the road, training and enjoying
cycling with my friends. This year (2025) I have started training to compete in the
national time trial championships!
Cycling and sport in general have been a gateway from my desk and it's been
countless times that I have solved a problem or came up with an idea
*while training*!

I also appreciate spending time in nature, with my partner and reading (avid
fantasy reader üêâ!)

Last, I use neovim btw B)
