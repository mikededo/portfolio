  `Hi! I‚Äôm Miquel (or Mike), a software engineer based in %link [Girona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girona)%`,
  `I‚Äôm a software engineer who mainly works with frontend frameworks, mainly with`,
  `React and Svelte. I‚Äôm also really interested in working with other technologies`,
  `and I often take the opportunity to challenge myself with Rust (for the Advent`,
  `of Code, mainly!).`,
  ``,
  `I‚Äôm always open for ideas, staying up to date with the technologies I use and also`,
  `learning and trying whatever I find interesting. While I have quite some projects`,
  `in my GitHub profile, most of them are simply a way for me to challenge myself and`,
  `try new things or approaches.`,
  `In a way, this portfolio is also a challenge/idea that came to my mind, most likely`,
  `while training on the bike.`,
  ``,
  `When I‚Äôm not in my desktop, I‚Äôm most likely on the road, training and enjoying`,
  `%comment TODO: Update the following line once it‚Äôs outdated! --&gt;%`,
  `cycling with my friends. This year (2025) I have started training to compete in the`,
  `national time trial championships!`,
  `Cycling and sport in general have been a gateway from my desk and it‚Äôs been`,
  `countless times that I have solved a problem or came up with an idea `,
  `*while training*!`,
  ``,
  `I also appreciate spending time in nature, with my partner and reading (avid`,
  `fantasy reader üêâ!)`,
