  `Hi! I‚Äôm Miquel (or Mike), a software engineer based in <span class="text-yellow hover:underline" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">[Girona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girona)</span>`,
  `I‚Äôm a software engineer who mainly works with frontend frameworks, mainly with`,
  `React and Svelte. I‚Äôm also really interested in working with other technologies`,
  `and I often take the opportunity to challenge myself with Rust (for the Advent`,
  `of Code, mainly!).`,
  ``,
  `I‚Äôm always open for ideas, staying up to date with the technologies I use and also`,
  `learning and trying whatever I find interesting. While I have quite some projects`,
  `in my GitHub profile, most of them are simply a way for me to challenge myself and`,
  `try new things or approaches.`,
  `In a way, this portfolio is also a challenge/idea that came to my mind, most likely`,
  `while training on the bike.`,
  ``,
  `When I‚Äôm not in my desktop, I‚Äôm most likely on the road, training and enjoying`,

  `Cycling and sport in general have been a gateway from my desk and it‚Äôs been`,
  `countless times that I have solved a problem or came up with an idea `,
  `*while training*!`,

  `I also appreciate spending time in nature, with my partner and reading (avid`,
