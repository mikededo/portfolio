# Interests

While I professionally work as a frontend developer with React, I'm really
interested in other web technologies. Over the past year, I've been learning and
developing with Svelte. Since then, I've become quite attached to it, and most
of my side projects are now built with Svelte and SvelteKit.

Svelte has helped me gain a deeper understanding of the web in general and,
surprisingly, how React works. Plus, with Svelte, I've been able to work more directly
with standard browser APIs, compared to working with React and ReactDOM.

I've always cared deeply about having a great developer experience. Both at work
and in my personal projects, I aim to improve DX for our frontend community
and my own workflow. Lately, I've been contributing more to ESLint, specifically
to ESLint's plugin for Svelte. In addition, I'm developing an ESLint plugin
for TailwindCSS and Svelte [more on the /projects page!](/projects)

Lastly, at the end of every year, I enjoy solving the Advent of Code challenges,
which I solve using Rust, a language I truly enjoy working with!

## When coding

I'm a keyboard enthusiast. When I first started coding, I was already exploring
VSCode shortcuts and found it incredibly satisfying to navigate and perform actions
with just a few keystrokes. I had heard about keyboard-driven text editors and, at
some point, installed the Vim extension in VSCode. That alone gave me a quick boost
in productivity. Once I became more comfortable with it, I transitioned to Neovim,
and since then, my entire workflow has moved to the terminal!

I've been using Neovim for around three years now, and I truly believe it has helped
me become a better developer. It pushed me to learn Lua and dive deep into open-source
projects. In fact, it even led to my first open-source contributions!

Currently, my setup is organized in a dotfiles repository, making it completely portable
in case I need or want to switch computers.

## When not coding

Outside of coding, I love training â€” specifically cycling. I started road cycling in 2021,
after COVID, and since then, it has become my passion. Now, I'm training to compete, as well
as helping my coach and a few friends improve their endurance development.

Health, nutrition, and endurance training are other topics I actively study in my spare time!
