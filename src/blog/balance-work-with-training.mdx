## The (im)possible equation

I work 40 to 60 hours per week, and train 15 to 25 hours. That is 55 to 85
hours of structured, non-negotiable commitment before you even account for
grocery shopping, commuting, maintaining a relationship, or the occasional
moment of stillness.

On paper, the math simply seems not work. It looks unsustainable, bordering on
masochistic. If you were to present this schedule to a conventional career
counselor or a wellness coach, they would likely tell you that you are on a
fast track to burnout.

In practice, however, the equation is solvable. In my city I've met many
athletes and high-performing professionals that prove it every day. For most of
my short career, I've been balancing demanding work and both gym and cycling
training, and I have learned that the secret isn't simply "grinding harder". If
you try to power through this lifestyle on willpower alone, you will fail. What
has worked for me has been structure. It is about treating your life as a
system where your professional ambition and your athletic goals are partners
rather than competitors.

This isn't a guide on how to suffer more effectively. It is a look at how to
structure a life that allows you to excel in two demanding domains
simultaneously without sacrificing your health or your sanity.

### The foundation: why this matters

Before we get into the logistics of nutrition, work plan or sleep hygiene, we
have to address the underlying "why". Why take this on? Why not just be a good
engineer and a casual cyclist, or a _professional-wannabe_ cyclist and a
part-time freelancer?

The answer lies in the cognitive interaction between the two domains. The
research is increasingly compelling: regular, structured physical training
improves cognitive function, emotional regulation, and creative
problem-solving. When you are deep in a complex debugging session or designing
a new system architecture, your brain is burning glucose and generating stress.
The physical resilience built on the bike translates directly into mental
resilience in the office.

Conversely, the discipline required to be a senior engineer—the ability to
plan, to execute, to analyze data, and to remain objective—is exactly what
makes a good athlete. The structured thinking of engineering prevents the
emotional volatility that ruins training plans.

When managed correctly, these two pillars of your life act as force
multipliers. The ride clears the mental debris from the code; the code provides
the structure to execute the ride. You are not splitting your energy; you are
circulating it.

### Strategic time architecture

The first step in solving the equation is accepting that not all hours are
created equal. A common mistake is trying to jam training into the early
morning simply because that’s what "disciplined people" do on social media. But
fighting your biology is a losing strategy. You have to design a schedule that
respects your natural energy rhythms and the specific demands of your job.

My own routine has evolved away from the standard "5 AM club." I found that
waking up too early compromised my sleep quality, which is the single biggest
performance killer. Instead, I operate on a mid-day split schedule that
leverages training as a hard reset button.

- Wake up at 7:00. I don't rush immediately out the door or check Slack from
bed. I take my time to wake up, play with cats,. From 8:00 to 11:00.
This is the time for the hardest architectural decisions, the complex logic, or
the tasks that require a fresh brain. I protect this time fiercely because I
know my mental acuity is highest here.
- From 11:00 to roughly 13:00 or 15:00 (depending on the duration of the
session), I train. This mid-day split serves a crucial psychological function. It breaks the
sedentary chain of the desk job. It floods the brain with oxygen and separates
the morning's cognitive load from the afternoon's execution tasks. When I
return to my desk, I am not dragging the morning's fatigue with me. I am
physically tired, perhaps, but mentally reset.
- I then work a second shift until 20:00. The company I'm working in at the
moment is based in San Francisco, so it's the time in which most of my meetings
are held.
- The day ends with a hard stop, enjoying dinner with my partner and reading
before bed. For the last 2 years, I've been trying to minimize screen time
during night-time. I get ready for sleep by 22:30. This isn't flexible.

<Schedule events={WORK_AND_TRAIN_SCHEDULE} />

This schedule works because it acknowledges a brutal truth: eight
hours of coding in a row rarely yields eight hours of value, just as riding for
five hours without fueling yields diminishing
returns.

### Nutrition as performance fuel

If time is the framework, nutrition is the fuel that keeps the engine running.
Training 15 to 25 hours weekly while working full-time creates a massive
caloric deficit. Underfueling is the silent killer in this lifestyle. If you do
not eat enough, the first thing to go won’t be your legs; it will be your
brain. You will experience brain fog, irritability, and an inability to focus
on code.

I base my nutrition entirely on meal prep. I don't have time to decide what to
eat three times a day, so I automate it. My diet centers entirely around
carbohydrates and protein, filling the rest with healthy fats. However, I don't
follow a rigid menu where every Tuesday is the same. Instead, I adjust my
macronutrient intake based on the specific physiological demand of that day's
workout.

I generally categorize my training sessions into three distinct types, each
with a unique fueling protocol.

#### The energy demand (aerobic volume)

These are the long endurance rides, usually 3 to 5 hours, characterized by
low-to-moderate intensity. The primary physiological governor here is glycogen
depletion. You are burning a mix of fat and sugar, but over 4 or 5 hours, the
tank will run dry.

On these days, I significantly increase carbohydrate consumption. This starts
with the meal before the ride, but crucially, it continues *during* the ride. I
am fueling the work as I do it. Post-workout, the focus is immediate
replenishment to ensure I don't crash during my 4:00 PM work meetings. If I
underfuel these rides, the afternoon work block becomes a struggle against
fatigue.

#### The muscular demand (high intensity)

These are shorter sessions, often 90 minutes to 2 hours, involving work over
LT2 (threshold) or anaerobic efforts. These rides hurt. The metabolic cost is
high, but the mechanical stress on the muscles is even higher. You are tearing
muscle fibers.

For these days, I keep carbohydrates relatively high to fuel the intensity—you
cannot hit high wattage without sugar—but the nutritional priority shifts
slightly toward protein. I ensure a high protein intake immediately
post-workout to support muscular repair. I also keep the evening meal
protein-heavy to support overnight recovery, ensuring I can wake up the next
day without heavy legs.

#### The hybrid demand (fatigue resistance)

These are the "monster" days. These are long rides (4+ hours) that also contain
mid-to-high intensity efforts, such as tempo blocks, sweetspot work, or fatigue
resistance intervals at the end of a long duration. This is where the
impossible equation is truly tested.

To survive these, I turn the carbohydrate intake up to the physiological limit.
I aim for 120g to 150g of carbohydrates *per hour* intra-workout. This requires
gut training; you cannot just decide to do this one day, or you will get sick.
But once adapted, this level of fueling is a superpower. It allows me to finish
a 5-hour hard ride and still have the mental clarity to write code effectively
for another four hours. On these days, I also slightly increase protein intake
throughout the rest of the day to mitigate the high overall systemic load.

### Sleep is the platform

There is a tendency in tech culture to view sleep as an optional optimization,
something you hack with supplements or caffeine. In athletic culture, however,
we know the truth: sleep is the platform upon which everything else rests.

There is no supplement, no cold plunge, and no massage gun that substitutes for
adequate sleep. If you are training 20 hours a week and working a high-stress
job, 6 hours of sleep is not "getting by." It is self-sabotage.

The key to my sleep strategy isn't just duration—though I aim for 8 hours—but
consistency. I aim to wake up and go to sleep at the same time every single
day, including weekends. Your circadian rhythm helps regulate hormone release
(cortisol in the morning, melatonin in the evening). When you have a sporadic
sleep schedule, you disrupt this rhythm, leading to lower sleep quality and
harder wake-ups.

I get ready for bed at 10:30 PM. This often means saying "no" to social events
or leaving dinner parties early. It means closing the laptop even if the code
isn't quite working yet. It requires discipline, but the reward is the ability
to sustain this lifestyle for years rather than months.

### The mental game: presence over perfection

Perhaps the most difficult part of this equation isn't the physical fatigue,
but the mental "context switching." Moving from the deep, logical focus of
engineering to the visceral, physical suffering of a threshold interval, and
then back to professional communication, is mentally expensive.

The danger is what I call "half-presence." This is when you are on the bike
thinking about a bug in the code, or sitting at your desk worrying about your
power numbers. This state of limbo is exhausting and ineffective. You end up
with a mediocre workout and mediocre work output.

The goal is distinct, compartmentalized presence. When I sit down at 8:00 AM, I
am an engineer. I am not an athlete. I do not look at TrainingPeaks; I look at
the IDE. When I kit up at 11:00 AM, I leave the engineer at the desk. I am an
athlete. The bug doesn't exist; only the interval exists.

I’ve found that the mid-day training split actually helps with this. The act of
changing clothes, checking the bike, and stepping outside serves as a
ritualistic "airlock" between my two identities. It allows me to leave the
frustration of a morning meeting on the road, so I can return to the afternoon
shift with a clean slate.

### Sustainability and the long game

Finally, it is vital to view this not as a six-week boot camp, but as a
long-term lifestyle. You cannot redline the engine every single day.

I build flexibility into the system. If I have a massive product launch or a
critical deadline, training volume drops. I don't stress about it; I simply
shift to maintenance mode. Conversely, if I have a training camp or a race
block, I try to keep the work demands steady and avoid taking on new, massive
projects.

Relationships also need to be factored into this equation. I meal prep not just
for myself, but to save time for my partner. We have clear agreements about
when I am unavailable and when I am fully present. If you don't communicate
your schedule clearly, your dedication will look like neglect to the people
around you.

Balancing this life is genuinely difficult. There will be days when you are
tired, days when you question why you are doing this, and days when you fail to
hit the mark in both domains. That is part of the process. But the attempt
itself develops capabilities that serve you in every area of existence:
discipline, time management, stress tolerance, and deep self-knowledge.

You can do this. Not perfectly, not every week, but consistently enough to
thrive. The goal isn't to be a machine; the goal is to be a human being who has
realized just how much capacity they actually have.
