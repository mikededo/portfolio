## The (im)possible equation

I work 40 to 60 hours per week, and train 15 to 25 hours. That is 55 to 85
hours of structured, non-negotiable commitment before you even account for
grocery shopping, commuting, maintaining a relationship, or the occasional
moment of stillness.

On paper, the math simply seems not to work, as it looks unsustainable,
bordering on masochistic. 

In practice, however, the equation is solvable. In my city I've met many
athletes and high-performing professionals that prove it every day. For most of
my short career, I've been balancing demanding work and studies, with both gym
and cycling training, and I have learned that the secret isn't simply "grinding
harder". If you try to power through this lifestyle on willpower alone, you
will fail. What has worked for me has been structure. It is about treating your
life as a system where your professional ambition and your athletic goals are
partners rather than competitors.

This isn't a guide, it is a look at how I structure my life so that allows m to
perform in two demanding domains simultaneously without sacrificing your health
or your sanity.

### The foundation: why this matters

Before we get into the logistics of nutrition, work plan or sleep hygiene, we
have to address the underlying "why". Why take this on? Why not just be a good
engineer and a casual cyclist, or a _professional-wannabe_ cyclist and a
part-time freelancer?

The answer lies in the cognitive interaction between the two domains. [Research
confirms](https://rhimrj.co.in/index.php/rhimrj/article/view/502) that regular,
structured physical training does not just build fitness; it sharpens your
focus, helps managing emotions and boosts the creative problem-solving skills.
When you are deep in a complex task, your brain is burning glucose and
generating stress. The physical grit you develop on the bike is the same mental
toughness you use to go through your work problems.

When managed correctly, these two pillars of your life act as force
multipliers. The training (riding in my case) clears the mental fog from the
work challenges. You can also thinking as you are circulating your energy,
rather than splitting it.

### Strategic time architecture

The first step in solving the equation is accepting that not all hours are
created equal. A common mistake is trying to smash training into the early
morning simply because that’s what instagram self-made guru's do. But
fighting your biology is a losing strategy. You have to design a schedule that
respects your specific natural energy rhythms and the specific demands of your
job.

In my case, I've always preferred waking up early, as I tend to dinner also
quite early, and not much later to bed. This allows me to start working early,
and jumping on the bike around midday, where the temperature is perfect,
specially in winter. During summer, unless I've been properly acclimated, I may
go out a couple of hours earlier, to avoid getting cooked at 40 degrees.

An overview of my schedule, is:

- Wake up at 7:00. I don't rush immediately out the door or check Slack from
bed. I take my time to wake up, play with cats, and usually stretch. From 8:00
to 11:00. This is the time for the hardest thinking decisions, the complex
logic, or the tasks that require a fresh brain. It is also when my teammates
are off, so hardly any meetings, nor distractions. I protect this time fiercely
because I know my mental state is highest here.
- From 11:00 to roughly 13:00 or 15:00 (depending on the duration of the
session), I train. This mid-day split serves a crucial psychological function,
and breaks the sedentary chain of the desk job. It allows me to disconnect
entirely from work (even though this is sometimes easier said than done), so
that when I come back I'm fresh. It's also an exercise I do: avoid thinking
about work, and focusing purely in the workout's goal.
- I then work a second shift until 20:00. The company I'm working in at the
moment is based in San Francisco, so it's the time in which most of my meetings
are held.
- The day ends with a hard stop, enjoying dinner with my partner and reading
before bed. For the last 2 years, I've been trying to minimize screen time
during night-time. I get ready for sleep by 22:30. This isn't flexible.

<Schedule events={WORK_AND_TRAIN_SCHEDULE} />

This schedule works because it acknowledges a brutal truth: eight hours of
coding in a row rarely yields eight hours of value, just as riding for five
hours without fueling yields diminishing returns. Stopping and context
switching, allows me to referesh remove the cognitive load that the first
session build up.

### Nutrition means performance

If time is the framework, nutrition is the fuel that keeps the engine running.
Training 15 to 25 hours weekly while working full-time creates a massive energy
demand. Underfueling is the silent killer in this lifestyle. If you do not eat
enough, the first thing to go won’t be your legs; it will be your brain. You
will experience brain fog, irritability, and an inability to focus on code.

I base my nutrition entirely on **meal prep**. I don't have time to decide what
to eat three times a day, so I automate it. My diet centers primarily around
**carbohydrates and protein**, filling the rest with healthy fats. However, I
don't follow a rigid, set-in-stone menu. Instead, I adjust my macronutrient
intake based on the specific physiological demands of that day's workout.

I generally categorize my training sessions into three distinct types, each
with a unique fueling protocol.

#### The endurance engine (aerobic volume)

These are the long rides, usually 3 to 5 hours, characterized by
low-to-moderate intensity. The primary physiological concern here is glycogen
depletion. You are burning a mix of fat and sugar, but over four or five hours,
the energy reserves will run dry.

<Macronutrients carbs={65} protein={25} fats={10} total={4500} />

On these days, I significantly increase carbohydrate consumption. This starts
with the meal before the ride, but critically, it continues *during* the ride.
I am fueling the work as I do it. Post-workout, the focus is immediate
replenishment to ensure I don't crash halfway through my afternoon work
meetings. If I underfuel these rides, the afternoon work block becomes a
struggle against fatigue.

#### The power builder (high intensity)

These are shorter sessions, often 90 minutes to 2 hours, involving work above
threshold or anaerobic efforts. The metabolic cost is high, but the mechanical
stress on the muscles is even higher. You are tearing muscle fibers.

<Macronutrients carbs={55} protein={40} fats={15} total={3500} />

For these days, I keep carbohydrates high to fuel the intensity—you cannot hit
high wattage without sugar—but the nutritional priority shifts slightly toward
protein. I ensure a high protein intake immediately post-workout to support
muscular repair. I also keep the evening meal protein-heavy to support
overnight recovery, ensuring I can wake up the next day without heavy legs.

#### The hybrid demand (fatigue resistance)

These are the "monster" days. These are long rides (4+ hours) that also contain
mid-to-high intensity efforts, such as tempo blocks, sweetspot work, or
resistance intervals at the end of a long duration. This is where the
impossible equation is truly tested.

<Macronutrients carbs={65} protein={20} fats={15} total={6000} />

To survive these, I turn the carbohydrate intake up to the physiological limit.
I aim for **120g to 150g of carbohydrates *per hour*** intra-workout. This
requires gut training; you cannot just decide to do this one day, or you will
get sick. But once adapted, this level of fueling is a superpower. It allows me
to finish a 5-hour hard ride and still have the mental clarity to write code
effectively for another four hours. On these days, I also slightly increase
protein intake throughout the rest of the day to mitigate the high overall
systemic load.

### Sleep is the platform

There is a tendency in tech culture to view sleep as an optional optimization,
something you hack with supplements or caffeine. In athletic culture, however,
we know the truth: **sleep is the platform upon which everything else rests.**

There is no supplement, no cold plunge, and no massage gun that substitutes for
adequate sleep. If you are training 20 hours a week and working a high-stress
job, 6 hours of sleep is not "getting by." It is self-sabotage.

The key to my sleep strategy isn't just duration—though I aim for **8
hours**—but **consistency**. I aim to wake up and go to sleep at the same time
every single day, including weekends. Your circadian rhythm helps regulate
crucial hormone release. When you have a sporadic sleep schedule, you disrupt
this rhythm, leading to lower sleep quality and harder wake-ups.

I get ready for bed at 10:30 PM. This often means saying "no" to social events
or leaving dinner parties early. It means closing the laptop even if the code
isn't quite working yet. It requires discipline, but the reward is the ability
to sustain this demanding lifestyle for years rather than months.

### The mental game: presence over perfection

Perhaps the most difficult part of this equation isn't the physical fatigue,
but the mental "context switching." Moving from the deep, logical focus of
engineering to the visceral, physical suffering of a threshold interval, and
then back to professional communication, is mentally expensive.

The danger is what I call **"half-presence."** This is when you are on the bike
thinking about a bug in the code, or sitting at your desk worrying about your
power numbers. This state of limbo is exhausting and ineffective. You end up
with a mediocre workout and mediocre work output.

The goal is **distinct, compartmentalized presence**. When I sit down at 8:00
AM, I am an engineer. I am not an athlete. I do not look at TrainingPeaks; I
look at the IDE. When I kit up at 11:00 AM, I leave the engineer at the desk. I
am an athlete. The bug doesn't exist; only the interval exists.

I’ve found that the mid-day training split actually helps with this. The act of
changing clothes, checking the bike, and stepping outside serves as a
**ritualistic "airlock"** between my two identities. It allows me to leave the
frustration of a morning meeting on the road, so I can return to the afternoon
shift with a clean slate.

### The necessity of time off: embracing recovery

The final, and most counter-intuitive, element of sustainable high performance
is the acceptance of **downtime**. You cannot redline the engine every single
day.

There is a false sense of security that comes with constant work and
training—the idea that if you stop, you'll fall behind. The opposite is true.
Time off, managed correctly, acts as a performance accelerant for both your
work and your fitness.

#### The physical break: letting the body catch up

Structured training mandates **rest weeks**. These are built into the cycle
where training volume is typically dropped by **30-50%** every third or fourth
week. This isn't just about recovering muscles; it's about letting the body
absorb all the fitness gains. If you keep training hard without a rest week,
you won't just plateau, you risk overtraining, which will compromise your
performance and emotional health.

#### The mental break: stepping away from the screen

The same logic applies to work. You need days where your brain is actively
discouraged from tackling complex problems. This isn't just about vacation;
it's about **active mental disconnection**. For me, this means taking a
Saturday morning to only read fiction, or scheduling a short, easy bike ride
that has no power goals attached—it's just moving. When you step away from the
IDE, you allow your **diffuse thinking mode** to process problems in the
background. Many times, the bug I couldn't solve on Friday afternoon suddenly
makes sense on Monday morning, not because I worked on it, but because I
stopped trying.

### Sustainability and the long game

Finally, it is vital to view this not as a six-week boot camp, but as a
**long-term lifestyle**. You cannot redline the engine every single day.

I build flexibility into the system. If I have a massive product launch or a
critical deadline, training volume drops. I don't stress about it; I simply
shift to maintenance mode. Conversely, if I have a training camp or a race
block, I try to keep the work demands steady and avoid taking on new, massive
projects.

**Relationships** also need to be factored into this equation. I meal prep not
just for myself, but to save time for my partner. We have clear agreements
about when I am unavailable and when I am fully present. If you don't
communicate your schedule clearly, your dedication will look like neglect to
the people around you.

Balancing this life is genuinely difficult. There will be days when you are
tired, days when you question why you are doing this, and days when you fail to
hit the mark in both domains. That is part of the process. But the attempt
itself develops capabilities that serve you in every area of existence:
discipline, time management, stress tolerance, and deep self-knowledge.

You can do this. Not perfectly, not every week, but consistently enough to
thrive. The goal isn't to be a machine; the goal is to be a human being who has
realized just how much capacity they actually have.
